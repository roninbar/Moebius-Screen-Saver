# The M&ouml;bius Clock

The M&ouml;bius Clock is an OpenGL program I wrote in 1999 to practice using different features of OpenGL.

It shows a 24-hour analog clock where the numbers are written along a M&ouml;bius strip, so that it takes the hours hand two complete revolutions to point at all the numbers, rather than just one as in an ordinary 12-hour analog clock.

### Download

The latest release is available [here](https://github.com/roninbar/moebius/releases/latest). Currently, the M&ouml;bius Clock is only available as a Windows screen saver. In the future I plan to build versions for other operating systems.

### Installation

1. Download the [zip file](https://github.com/roninbar/moebius/releases/latest/download/moebius-clock.zip).
2. Extract the `.scr` file to any folder that doesn't require special access privileges (e.g. your `Desktop` or your `Downloads` folder).
3. Right-click the `.scr` file and choose **Install**.
4. If a Windows antivirus warning pops up ("Windows protected your PC"), click the **More info** link and then press the **Run anyway** button.
5. Alternatively, you can run it as a stand-alone app by double-clicking the `.scr` file or by choosing **Test** from its context menu.
