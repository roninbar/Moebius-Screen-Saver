# The M&ouml;bius Clock

The M&ouml;bius Clock is an OpenGL program I wrote in 1999 to practice using different features of OpenGL.

It is a 24-hour analog clock where the numbers are written along a M&ouml;bius strip, so that it takes the hours hand two complete revolutions to point at all the numbers, rather than just one as in an ordinary 12-hour analog clock.
